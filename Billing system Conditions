# Super Market Billing System
Design and implement a supermarket billing system using Python that effectively handles multiple billing functionalities. The system should allow for the input of multiple items, process their individual prices, and apply discounts where applicable. Using conditional statements and loops, the program should calculate the total bill, including any applicable discounts, and generate an itemized receipt for the customer. The system should be interactive and capable of handling real-time input, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the final output.
