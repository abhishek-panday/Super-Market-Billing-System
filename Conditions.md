# Super Market Billing System Conditions

Design and implement a supermarket billing system using Python that effectively handles multiple billing functionalities. The system should allow for the input of multiple items, process their individual prices, and apply discounts where applicable. Using conditional statements and loops, the program should calculate the total bill, including any applicable discounts, and generate an itemized receipt for the customer. The system should be interactive and capable of handling real-time input, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the final output.

# Key requirements 
- The system must allow for multiple items to be processed in a single transaction.
- Conditional statements should be used to apply discounts based on criteria (e.g., total amount, item type, or promotions).
- The program should calculate and display the subtotal, any discounts applied, and the final total amount due.
- The itemized bill should display the name, quantity, price of each item, and the final total after discounts.
- Loops should be utilized to handle continuous input of items until the billing process is complete.
